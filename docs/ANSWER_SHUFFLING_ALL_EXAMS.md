## 🔄 How It Works (For All Exams)

### Before Fix (❌ Gaming Possible):
```
Student sees:
Q1: Option A=Correct ← Always A!
Q2: Option A=Correct ← Always A!
Q3: Option A=Correct ← Always A!

Result: Select ALL A → 100% Score ❌ UNFAIR
```

### After Fix (✅ Fair & Secure):
```
Same questions but SHUFFLED OPTIONS:

Student 1 sees:      Student 2 sees:      Student 3 sees:
Q1: B=Correct        Q1: D=Correct        Q1: C=Correct
Q2: A=Correct        Q2: B=Correct        Q2: A=Correct
Q3: C=Correct        Q3: A=Correct        Q3: D=Correct

Result: Select ALL A → ~25% Score (random chance) ✅ FAIR
```

## 📊 How Shuffling Works (Technical)

```javascript
// Original Question (from database)
{
  question: "What is 2+2?",
  options: ["4", "5", "6", "7"],
  correct_answer: 0  // Position 0 = "4"
}

// After Shuffling (different for each student)
{
  question: "What is 2+2?",
  options: ["6", "4", "7", "5"],      // Shuffled!
  correct_answer: 1                   // Now position 1 = "4"
}

// Result: Same question, different correct position!
```
