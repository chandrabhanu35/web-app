## 🚀 Production Deployment Checklist

### MUST DO (Critical)
- [ ] Generate strong `JWT_SECRET` 
- [ ] Set `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to your domain
- [ ] Change default admin password
- [ ] Enable HTTPS (get SSL certificate)
- [ ] Create `.env` file with secure values

### SHOULD DO (Highly Recommended)
- [ ] Set up rate limiting
- [ ] Enable audit logging
- [ ] Add security headers (Helmet.js)
- [ ] Set up monitoring & alerts
- [ ] Enable database backups

### NICE TO HAVE (Optional)
- [ ] Implement 2FA for admin
- [ ] Add token refresh mechanism
- [ ] Create API versioning
- [ ] Encrypt sensitive data at rest

## 🧪 Test the Fixes

### Test 1: Admin login works
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"bhanu@aptitude.com","password":"Ncb8008535@"}'
```
Expected: Token returned ✅

### Test 2: Admin can access admin endpoints
```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/admin/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```
Expected: Statistics returned ✅

### Test 3: Regular user BLOCKED from admin
```bash
# First create regular user, then:
curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/admin/stats \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer REGULAR_USER_TOKEN"
```
Expected: 403 Forbidden ✅

### Test 4: Invalid input rejected
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/auth/signup \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"X","email":"invalid","mobile":"abc","password":"12345"}'
```
Expected: Validation error ✅

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Is my app vulnerable to SQL injection?
**A:** No. You use parameterized queries which prevent SQL injection 100%.

### Q: Can someone access admin endpoints without being admin?
**A:** Not anymore. Fixed in `routes/admin.js` using `verifyAdmin` middleware.

### Q: Are password hashes exposed?
**A:** Not anymore. Fixed in `routes/admin.js` by filtering sensitive fields.

### Q: What's the biggest risk now?
**A:** Brute force password attacks. Implement rate limiting for production.

### Q: When can I go live?
**A:** After:
1. Setting JWT_SECRET in .env
2. Changing default admin password
3. Setting ALLOWED_ORIGINS for your domain
4. Enabling HTTPS

That's 4 things, takes 20 minutes. Then you can deploy!

### Q: What about rate limiting?
**A:** Recommended but not blocking. The app works without it, just less protected from brute force.

### Q: Do I need 2FA?
**A:** Optional. Good to have for admin accounts in production, but not required.
